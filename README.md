### Welcome!

## At work:
- Bridging the gap between enterprise windows package management, and cloud native technologies.
  - Windows package management is messy. It doesn't have to be, Im working towards fixing this at [Intility](https://intility.no/en/).
  - Creating and maintaining API's and standards that unify the modern and the established.
  - Automating the creation and maintenance of application packages. Winget is not enough :)
- Languages, frameworks, tools and technologies I use ~daily:
  - [Winget](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/)
  - C#
  - [.NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core)
  - Powershell / [pwsh](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell)
  - [PSADT](https://github.com/PSAppDeployToolkit/PSAppDeployToolkit)
  - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
  - [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/) / [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
  - Linux
  - [Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm)
  - GitLab
  - [MEMCM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/configmgr/) & [Intune](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise-mobility-security/microsoft-intune)
  - Windows 10 & 11

## Personal projects:
- Home Automation
  - My platform of choice is [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/). It gives me all the flexibility I need, and I get to host it myself.
  - I try to make a smart home, not a remote controlled home.  
    Me turning on the lights in an app is in my view not better than pressing the light switch on the wall.
- [HomeServer](https://github.com/khaffner/homeserver)
  - My containerized services at home. The repo mostly acts as backup and docs, changes there do not automatically apply.
- IoT
  - (What even is IoT? Things that are not computers? I like to define it as headless computers with sensor reporting as main purpose)
  - [Elbin](https://github.com/khaffner/elbin). Code, config and docs for everything running on an electrical boat.
  - [Maxus](https://github.com/khaffner/Maxus). Code, config and docs for everything running in my electrical van.
    - It started out as a need for rear view mirror (as the van does not have it).  
      A camera and a Pi in the rear door, accessible over local wifi.  
      But then, might as well add other cool sensors and stuff.
- Consumer automation
  - Tools for automating various interactions with companies that have an API.
  - [Kolonial](https://github.com/khaffner/kolonial), an online grocery store. I always buy about the same stuff, but also want the greatest deals. So I automated the selection of products.
