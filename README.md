# Kevin Haffner

### Welcome!

If you're reading this, you might be interested in what I'm doing at work and/or what kind of projects I enjoy personally.

## At work:
- Bridging the gap between enterprise windows package management, and cloud native technologies.
  - Windows package management is messy. It doesn't have to be, Im working towards fixing this at [Intility](https://intility.no/en/).
  - Creating and maintaining API's and standards that unify the modern and the established.
- Languages, frameworks, tools and technologies I use ~daily:
  - C#
  - [.NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core)
  - Powershell/[pwsh](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell)
  - [PSADT](https://github.com/PSAppDeployToolkit/PSAppDeployToolkit)
  - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
  - [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/)/[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
  - Linux
  - [Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm)
  - GitLab
  - [MEMCM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/configmgr/) & [Intune](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise-mobility-security/microsoft-intune)
  - Windows 10

## Personal projects:
- Home Autmomation
  - My platform of choice is Home Assistant. It gives me all the flexibility I need, and I get to host it myself.
- IoT
  - I find sensors and electronics fascinating. That, combined with my preference for containerizing as much as possible, \
    got me started on [Elbin](https://github.com/khaffner/elbin). Code, config and documentation for everything running on an electrical boat.
- Consumer automation
  - Tools for automating various interactions with companies that have an API.
  - [Kolonial](https://github.com/khaffner/kolonial), an online grocery store. I always buy about the same stuff, but also want the greatest deals. So I automated the selection of products.
  - [BoozeStack](https://github.com/khaffner/BoozeStack) (I suck at naming). Trying to create a unified solution for finding the right product at Vinmonopolet or Systembolaget.
